Proposal <br/>

Our team will be working on a project that provides a platform for interior designers <br/>
to share and discover work produced by other interior designers and architects.<br/>
It will allow designers to connect from all over the world and allows them to get feedback,<br/>
get hired, or improve their work. The platform additionally provides users with <br/>
recommendations of work by other users and will help users find designers
that they may want to work with very easily. <br/>
